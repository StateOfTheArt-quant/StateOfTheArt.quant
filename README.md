# StateOfTheArt.quant
The scope of this repository is to keep track of state of the art (SoTA) results for machine learning (ML) algorithms applied in quantitative trading domain. Specifically, this repo is to collect and report quantitative trading model performance metrics under diffenent types of  environments, including

* Academic/Industrial
* Train/Dev/Test dataset
* Backtest/Paper-trading/Production

this is an attempt to release 
1. a set of concrete and reliable benchmarks
2. state-of-the art(SoTA) results

to help reseacher explore and expand the boundary of predictability.

We're looking for pull requests related to results from papers or reliable disclosure we should add, and better organization of the results.
